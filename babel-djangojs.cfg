[extractors]
# We use a custom extractor to find translatable strings in AngularJS
# templates. The extractor is included in horizon.utils for now.
# See http://babel.pocoo.org/docs/messages/#referencing-extraction-methods for
# details on how this works.
angular = horizon.utils.babel_extract_angular:extract_angular

[javascript: **.js]

# We need to look into all static folders for HTML files.
# The **/static ensures that we also search within
# /openstack_dashboard/dashboards/XYZ/static which will ensure
# that plugins are also translated.
